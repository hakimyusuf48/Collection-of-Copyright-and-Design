# Collection-of-Copyright-and-Design

Welcome and see what I made. Just a few projects I did while I was studying and just building my portfolio. This repo just has my copywrite and design projects.
I just made them as one since it was not much so why not add them in one project. I suggest you read the pdf file in the main directory.
The time I did these projects were back in 2023, which was my first year of Eduvos.

## LaTeX Project

The main pdf file in the main directory was made with LaTeX so that I can show I still have the skill and produce an easy read about this project.
There are other 2 files in the LaTeX repo.

## Blog website

I made this website to show my passion of Linux and the upcoming big changes at that time of my assignment. I still believe the year of the Linux will come soon too.

## Figma

This showcase my skills of UI design that I did to improve an existing website that was so messy to a design with a good design principles.
